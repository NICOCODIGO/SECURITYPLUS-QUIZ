<h1>Security+ Learning Platform</h1> 
<h2>🚧 Actively being developed</h2>

This project is an interactive web application designed to help students prepare for the CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701) exam. The app will include structured lessons, domain-based quizzes, PBQs (Performance-Based Questions), progress tracking, and a clean learning interface inspired by Pearson/CertMaster-style platforms.

I am currently building the front-end components, lesson pages, quiz logic, and UI layout. Back-end integration (AWS, databases, authentication, etc.) will be added later once the UI experience is finalized.

<h2>What to expect</h2>

Building a clean, responsive front-end UI

Designing the Lessons page, Quiz page, and layout components

Creating mock lesson + quiz data to test UI flow

Structuring the folder architecture for scalability

Adding interactive quiz features (difficulty filter, question slider, timer, etc.)
